type 'a t
(** A completion port that passes key data of type ['a]. *)

(** A handle to an in-flight asynchronous job, this can be used to cancel the job
    in some cases. *)

    to the flags when opening the file. *)

(** [pipe name] creates a named pipe ready for asynchronous operations. *)

(** [get_queued_completion_status t] will wait indefinitely for a completion packet to arrive 
    at the completion port [t]. *)

val peek : 'a t -> 'a completion_status option

    the request. *) *)

    will be updated to contain the remote address of the incoming connection.
